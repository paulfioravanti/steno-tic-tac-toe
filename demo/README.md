# Steno Demo Artefacts

This directory contains the following files:

- [Demo script][]: This is what I used as my guide through the demo. It has
  information that includes talking points, what code/text I should write at
  what point in what order, as well as what [snippets][] I should use, and what
  [steno outlines][] I should use for certain words.
- [Tape Output][]: This is the unedited output of all the steno keystrokes I
  made during the demo. If you would like more information on how to actually
  read the output, [Stanley Sakai][]'s video [Stan's Quick and Dirty: How
  Stenography Works][] is a _fantastic_ primer for this, as well as being a
  great introduction to stenography in general.
- [Demo snippets][]: My general purpose vim snippets are located in [my vim
  snippets repo][]. For this demo, I used one "cheat" snippet to save me
  the trouble of writing a bunch of arrays containing game winning position
  indices (and save you from having to watch it...). Aside from that "cheat",
  all other code was written "freehand" steno without any copy/paste.
- Images that I used to explain what React components I planned to create in the
  application implementation
